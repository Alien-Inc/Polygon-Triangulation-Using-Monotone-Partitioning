# Polygon-Triangulation-Using-Monotone-Partitioning

#### A Triangulation Policy, developed in C++  is a project for partitioning a Concave Polygon into multiple Convex pieces for efficient use of various other Geometric algorithms. It is based on the Monotone Partitioning Algorithm and the user experience is enhanced using the OpenGL Utility Toolkit..
